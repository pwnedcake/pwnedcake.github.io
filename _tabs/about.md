## Introduction

Hey there! I'm **Wathsala Dewmina**, a cyber security enthusiast with a deep passion for breaking things to make them stronger. My focus lies in enterprise-level internal security, particularly Active Directory ecosystems where the real battles are fought. I spend my days hunting for privilege escalation paths, identifying misconfigurations, and mapping lateral-movement opportunities within complex network infrastructures.

I believe that true security isn't about building higher walls it's about understanding how attackers think, move, and exploit. Through red teaming, internal and external penetration testing, and detection-evasion techniques, I help organizations secure what matters most: their core infrastructure.

When I'm not researching the latest attack vectors or developing proof-of-concept exploits, you'll find me competing in CTF challenges, contributing to the security community, and constantly pushing the boundaries of what I know.
